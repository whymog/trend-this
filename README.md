#Trend This, Buddy  
##A Chrome Extension for hiding Facebook's Trending section from the News Feed sidebar  

The Trending widget has been getting under my skin for quite some time, so I wrote a quick fix to get rid of it. 

If you want to install it yourself:  

1. Clone this repository  
2. In Chrome, navigate to `chrome://extensions` and check the "Developer mode" checkbox at the top  
3. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and navigate to the folder you cloned
